# Convert GRIB source datasets to zarr

This tool is currently being refactored based on [danra-to-zarr](https://github.com/leifdenby/dmi-danra-to-zarr/) from [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) based pipelines to [snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake) to make the tool more lightweight.

Documentation will appear soon :) But you can join our slack channel to ask questions: https://ml-lam.slack.com/archives/C087NMFV4A0
